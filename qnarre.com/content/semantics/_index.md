## [Structural Morphing to Preserve Semantics](./book/06-morphings)

* Current category theory picks and highlights
* Existing Typescript to Javascript morphings
* Python morphing patterns and anti-patterns
* Is Julia "categorically" similar? Why bother?
* Shared semantics and significant differences
* Configurable morphing infrastructure
* Few implementation details and future work
* Integration with the Language Server framework
* Comparison metrics through morphings

## [From Structural Morphings to Conflict Graphs](./book/00-introduction)

* Is "understanding" necessary in state-of-the-art NLP?
* "Simplified" content to structurally morphable text
* Comparison metrics revisited and extended
* Visualizing differences: conflict graphs
* Applying the results to simple "bipolar" legal text
* Complexity and scaling issues considered
* Few implementation details and future work

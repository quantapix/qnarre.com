I am interested in algorithmically seeking out **contradictions** and **inconsistencies** in deceitful text, specifically in "bipolar" legal text. Here is my [resume](/resume.pdf) and personal ["history"](/history.pdf).

My public [repositories](https://github.com/quantapix) are under intense development with a [court-imposed](https://femfas.net/routine/d22_06_02/) deadline.

I have been threatened, arrested (most recently on 1/21/2022, see my petition and [appeal](https://femfas.net/rights/d22_04_08/) to the Mass. Supreme Judicial Court) and ordered to apply for 10 jobs a week.

With a total of over 210 job applications submitted by the suddenly dismissed hearing on 6/3/2022, I clearly cannot claim "great matches" with any of them, specifically because of the particular circumstances of my relevant work since 2017.

A successful application for an ordered full-time position would also mean abandoning my ~$1M investment in my company Quantapix, along with all my personal savings and my entire retirement at age 60.

Additionally, if my lawsuits for damages (e.g. [discriminations and violations of civil rights](https://femfas.net/rights/d21_12_01/)) fail, I certainly will be sent to jail. If my appeals and/or lawsuits succeed in the next few months, I would be left with no sane reason to abandon Quantapix.
